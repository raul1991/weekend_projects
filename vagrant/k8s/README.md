# Overview

This project is just to check my understanding of ansible and little of vagrant.

# Prerequisites

- ansible -> a way to configure VMs
- vagrant -> orchestrates creation/deletion of VM on virtual box
- virtualbox -> This to create machines where k8s nodes will live

# Setting up 2-node cluster for k8s using ansible vagrant

Run the vagrant file in this project's root to set it up.
